#Chrome App Card UI

This is an attempt to recreate the Google card UI in a floating Chrome app window.  You can test it out by cloning the repo and then loading the cloned directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome/Chromium.

It requires the ability to create transparent windows, which was experimental up through Chrome 31.  Thus, this app specifies a minimum Chrome version of 32.
